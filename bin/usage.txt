USAGE

    nwm [options]

By default, this starts the nwm window manager.

OPTIONS

    --init      Generate a nwm.desktop file, e.g. `nwm --init > /usr/share/xsessions/nwm.desktop`
    --help      Show this help
    --version   Show version info

STARTUP PATHS

When nwm is launched, it will first look for a file or folder called 
`~/.nwm-user` (e.g. `~/.nwm-user.js` or `~/.nwm-user/index.js`). This file allows you to customize your nwm keyboard shortcuts and overall behavior.

If this file is not found, then the default `nwm-user-sample.js` is used to launch the window manager.
