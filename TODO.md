# nwm refactor

## nwm.js

nwm is implemented over the native binding.

It binds event handlers to all the main events:

- addMonitor: a new monitor is added
- updateMonitor: an existing monitor is changed (e.g. resolution changes)
- removeMonitor: a monitor is removed (e.g. disconnect external monitor)
- addWindow: a new window is added
- updateWindow: the properties of the window change, like the window title
- removeWindow: the window is closed
- fullscreen: a window requests full screen mode
- configureRequest: a window wants to change it's size, stacking order or border width. Generally we only want to allow events that don't screw up the layout.
- mouseDown / mouseDrag: WIP mouse events
- enterNotify: mouse enters a new window
- rearrange: the native binding suggests a rearrange, generally because a monitor or window was removed
- keyPress: a key combination that we previously registered in the native binding was pressed

and makes changes to the associated items:

- monitors
- layoutspaces
- windows

# Global state

monitors: set of monitors
monitors[n].workspaces[n]: set of workspaces
monitors[n].workspaces[n]["tile"]: the tile workspace on monitor 1, workspace 2.

currentMonitor: the monitor the focus is on right now
currentWorkspace: the currently active workspace

# Layout workspaces

Events are only emitted to the active workspace on each monitor.

- addWindow: when a new window is added, or when a window is moved to the workspace
- removeWindow: when a window is closed, or when a window is moved out of the workspace
- rearrange( ): move windows into their correct places. All layouting operations should occur here and not during addWindow/removeWindow. Always called after all windows added/removed.

# Keyboard

Key bindings emit intents, which the layouts handle.

# Monitors

The monitor is:

- responsible for knowing which windows have been assigned to which workspaces.
- responsible for moving windows to new workspaces
- responsible for triggering rearranges on the workspace

Monitors have:

- a width and height
- x and y coordinates (within the root X window)
- a list of workspaces and a list of windows for each workspace

# Layoutspaces / workspaces

Layoutspaces are a combination of workspace and layout.

It makes more sense to combine the two - every workspace has a layout, and more advanced layouts need to store stuff.




# Todo (C++ bindings)

Todo:

- Expose stacking order and stacking operations (C)
- Display full info of PropertyNotify, ClientMessage, ConfigureRequest and ConfigureNotify as nwm should not honor some requests e.g. guake Ctrl+shift+t.
- Test reloading key bindings on the fly (C)
- Customizable mouse key bindings (C)
- Opacity bindings (C)

# Todo (Nwm.js)

Rethinking the JS collections:

Instead of having NWM own a canonical set of windows and monitors, have windows in an array on the nwm-user-sample side.

Do not track the current monitor in the window. Instead:
- Each monitor contains workspaces. Each workspace is always on a particular monitor.
- windows are added and removed from workspaces when they are moved.
- Windows should not have a monitor property
- Windows should not have a workspace property

Every item (monitor, window, layoutspace) should be accessed with a numeric index in an array.
Lazy initialization should not exist. Errors should be thrown for non-numeric accesses.

Events defined in terms of nwm.on(), eg:
- Monitor: nwm.on('add window'), nwm.on('change window monitor'),
 nwm.on('remove window'), nwm.on('before remove monitor') should be removed and transferred to the actual event callback.

When the state of a window, monitor, or workspace changes, events should fire notifying the appropriate handlers to resize and rearrange the layout, instead of calling .show()/.hide() methods each time something is updated.

Layouts and workspaces should be merged.

The layouts should be able to store their own data, such as lists of window ids.

The layouts should not be updated when windows are removed/added, but only when they are redrawn.

When the layouts are redrawn, they should be updated.

Updates should be exposed like this:

1) layoutspace sends its known windows
2) it gets a set of added windows (new ids) and a set of removed ids
3) it then updates whatever internal structures are used accordingly
4) then the render calculations take place

This allows direct updates as well, and means that the sanity check can be done once.

The monitor is responsible for knowing which windows have been assigned to which workspaces.
The layoutspace is responsible for maintaining it's own "main window", "window order" and so forth; as well as for implementing add() and remove() for sanity checking all it's internal structures.

The monitor keeps an object indexed by layout name, and keeps track of which layout is active. That particular layoutspace object then receives the notification.

Windows never change monitor, they just move from one layoutspace association to another.

Hiding() and showing() a window should only affect the current layoutspace. So if you stay on the same workspace but switch layout, then the window should be shown again.

 There are many cases where we just want to sanity check the window list:
 - when retrieving the main window for a workspace


- Multi-monitor bug fixes:
  - Transient windows which are too large to fit the current monitor should be resized (JS)
  - Transient windows should be repositioned to the current screen when they open (JS)
- Test with conky and dzen, figure out how to make integration w/those easy (JS)
- Website and tutorial e.g. http://xmonad.org/tour.html
- Saving state on exit (JS)
- Floating window mode for Flash fullscreen etc. (JS)
